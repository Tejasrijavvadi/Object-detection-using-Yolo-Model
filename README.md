# Object-detection-using-Yolo-Model
Developed a two-microservice system using FastAPI forobject detection. The AI Backend uses YOLOv8 to perform inference on uploaded images, generating both annotated output images and structured JSON detections (class, confidence, bounding box). The UI Backend provides a simple upload interface and communicates with the AI backend via HTTP.
